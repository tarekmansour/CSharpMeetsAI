# CSharpMeetsAI

A beginner-friendly exploration of AI integration with .NET and C#. This project uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and aims to try other tools to build real-world applications. Perfect for developers curious about **AI** and modern .NET capabilities.

## üöÄ Goals

- Learn how to integrate AI models with C# and .NET
- Experiment with local LLMs using Ollama.
- Experiment MCP Servers.
- Experiment Microsoft Agent Framework.
- Build simple, real-world AI-powered applications.

## .NET Projects

- `CSharpMeetsAI.AppHost`: Serves as the entry point and host for the application, managing configuration and startup logic.
- `CSharpMeetsAI.ServiceDefaults`: Provides default implementations and shared utilities to support the service layer.
- `CSharpMeetsAI.Api`: Exposes HTTP endpoints, handles requests/responses.
